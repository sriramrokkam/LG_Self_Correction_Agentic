    "# IntelliAgent: Multi-Agent System with SAP AI Core\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook implements a multi-agent system that uses SAP AI Core for intelligent task execution. The system consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Worker Agent (using gpt-4.1)\n",
    "   - Handles complex task execution\n",
    "   - Uses web browsing tools\n",
    "   - Maintains conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluator Agent (using mistral-small-instruct)\n",
    "   - Validates responses\n",
    "   - Provides structured feedback\n",
    "   - Makes decisions on task completion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in this Notebook:\n",
    "1. Setup and Dependencies\n",
    "2. Schema Definition\n",
    "3. Tool Configuration\n",
    "4. SAP AI Core Integration\n",
    "5. Model Configuration\n",
    "6. Agent Implementation\n",
    "7. Graph Construction\n",
    "8. User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- SAP AI Core credentials in .env file\n",
    "- Python environment with required packages\n",
    "- Network access to SAP AI Core endpoints\n"

      "Recommendation for AI Engineers/Developers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If your work heavily involves deep learning, training models on Nvidia GPUs, or requires specialized Windows-only enterprise software, Windows is likely the better choice due to superior hardware support and compatibility.\n",
      "- If you prefer a UNIX-based environment, seamless integration with open-source tools, and develop for iOS/macOS or value system stability and security, macOS is highly recommended.\n",
      "- For most enterprise developers, especially those working in web, mobile (cross-platform), and software engineering, macOS offers a robust, developer-friendly platform with reliable tools and security. However, for AI engineers requiring heavy GPU compute, Windows with dedicated Nvidia hardware is optimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Recommendation:\n",
      "For general enterprise developers and AI engineers not reliant on GPU training, macOS is recommended for its UNIX environment, stability, and security. For AI engineers focused on deep learning or requiring Windows-only tools, choose Windows with high-end Nvidia GPU support. Consider your organization's enterprise integration needs and hardware budget when making a final decision.\n",
      "Feedback: Evaluator Feedback on this answer: The Assistant addressed previous feedback by providing a more detailed comparison table, with clear distinctions between macOS and Windows across several developer-relevant aspects. The recommendation section is well-reasoned, directly considers the needs of both general enterprise developers and AI engineers, and takes enterprise-specific factors into account. The table and recommendations are sufficiently detailed and tailored for developers, especially those working in AI. The success criteria are met, and no further user input is required unless additional detail or a more specific use case is desired.\n"
